> The missing piece in react and react-native form management

## Ideology üìÑ
For the longest time, build complex forms with validation has been a total pain point in both `react` and `react-native`. While there have been some progress in terms of packages, they still tend to run into following issues:

- Too complex, verbose and comes with way too much boilerplate
- Packages have grown too big, unfocused and are trying to do too many things at once
- Performance issues with syncing multiple effects causing issues in large forms
- Missing extensibility locking you into specific solution or environment
- Missing proper type-safety, ending up in scenarios where either you don't have type-support at all, or you end up more fighting against it than it actually being helpful.

eformless attemptss to address all of the aforementioned issues


## Features :gem:
- Super lightweight *(one of the smallest and efficient form libraries on the market)*
- Works accross all environments *(react, react-native, next, remix, astro, it just works)*
- Configurable *(manage individual fields or even entire package)*
- Extensible *(do you like using zod, yup, superstruct, or even your own solution? eformless is built with extensibility in mind)*
- Type-safe *(100% built with typescript, uses inferrence to make sure yuor field and form is always correctly typed)*
